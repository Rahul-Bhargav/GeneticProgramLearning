# GeneticProgramLearning

Implementation of Neural program learning using a genetic algorithm based on the following paper: [Genetic programming as a means for programming computers by natural selection](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00175355).
The code is based on the example specified in Symbolic regression-empirical data.
This repository uses a modified version of [gplearn]() to accomodate histogram analysis.
